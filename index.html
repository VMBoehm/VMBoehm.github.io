							<h2>Vanessa Böhm<br />
							Astrophysics, Machine Learning and More</h2>
						</header>
						<p> I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics at UC Berkeley with expertise in machine learning, simulation-based data analysis and Bayesian inference. In my research I develop and apply data analysis techniques that can extract relevant physics from the large, high-dimensional and non-Gaussian data provided by modern astrophysical experiments. One example is weak gravitational lensing. Upcoming measurements of this effect promise to reveal new insights into the fundamental physics of our Universe. To extract this information it will be crucial to develop new analysis methods that can optimally characterize the small scales resolved by high-precision experiments.
				</p>														
<p> Apart from my work in astrophysics, I am also broadly interested in solving challenging data analysis problems in the physical sciences and beyond. In spring of 2020, collaborators and I used machine learning to provide one of the earliest and at the time most accurate estimates of the COVID-19 fatality. In a recently formed collaboration, I am working with Biophysicists at UC Berkeley to develop ML tools for protein design. Outside of my day-to-day research I am interested in climate science, geology, and urban planning.

								<h3>Gender Gap in Astronomy widened during COVID</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0.2cm;">
								Using publication data, my colleague Jia Liu and I have analyzed trends in the productivity of Astrophysicists during the COVID-19 pandemic. We disseminate our results by career-stage, gender and country. We observe an increase in productivity in the last two years compared to previous years, but that this increase is not shared equally between men and women. A decrease in the number of first-time authors indicates barriers for young researchers to enter the field or complete their first projects.

								<h3>Announcing ML for Astrophysics Workshop</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0.2cm;"> The thirty-ninth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), which will take place in Baltimore from July 17 to July 23 2022, will feature its first workshop on 'Machine Learning for Astrophysics'. The goal of this workshop is to bring together ML researchers and domain experts in the field of Astrophysics to discuss the key open issues which hamper the use of deep learning for scientific discovery. We invite reserearchers from all domains of Astrophysics to submit their work.</p>

						<h2>Research</h2>
						
						<p> In recent research I have developed a differentiable simulation code that produces accurate, fully non-linear weak lensing maps at low computational cost. Codes like this pave the way to a new era of weak gravitational lensing data analysis. In earlier research, I have explored corrections to lensing observables due to inaccurate theoretical modeling. As a result, I have identified an important bias to CMB lensing measurements that future and current experiments will have to correct for.
						</p>
						<p> During my postdoc at UC I have specialized in machine learning and created ML-based algorithms for scientific applications. The methods I develop exploit the powers of machine learning and deep neural networks while meeting the needs of the scientific community: reliable uncertainty estimation, little fine-tuning and fast and easy training. To achieve this, I combine the best of two worlds: traditional (Bayesian) statistics and deep learning. My latest algorithms can be used for accurate anomaly detection, posterior analysis in high dimensions and artificial data generation. Browse my recent publications to learn more.
